  "content": "The Risk Exchange v1 module replaces the original User Risk Exchange and Application Risk Exchange workflows. This new module is designed to ingest one or multiple plugged-in vendorsâ€™ user or device risk scores, and create a single view of individual contributors to the companies overall risk score. Its rules-based engine matches single or multiple vendor scores, or a derived weighted score, to trigger notifications and drive highly-focused orchestrated actions to reduce the risk from individual users or devices. Click play to learn how to set up User Risk Exchange to drive zero trust enforcement inside Netskope. Risk Exchange Global Settings Only write access users can change Risk Exchange Global Settings. After the Risk Exchange module is enabled ( Settings > General ), go to Settings > Risk Exchange . There are four tabs: General, Logs Cleanup, Flap Suppression, and Records Cleanup. On the General tab, you can enable generating alerts that are shared with the Ticket Orchestrator module. Select the maintenance window time interval, and during this time, interval Risk Exchange actions (that are configured to be performed in the maintenance window) will be performed. On the Logs Cleanup tab, you can specify how often to delete logs. On the Flap Suppression tab, you can prevent an action from being triggered multiple times in a short duration. On the Records Cleanup tab, set the option to enable/disable data purging, and then set a time duration for the records to remain inactive. After that, the duration records will be deleted from Cloud Exchange as specified. Schema Editor A write-access user can manage Risk Exchange schemas and their fields. View Risk Exchange Entities View and edit any of the created entities and their fields. Go to Risk Exchange > Schema Editor . A list of all the available fields in the selected entity will be displayed. Create New Fields A write-access user can create Risk Exchange entity fields. The supported field types are explained in the following sections. Calculated Field Type A calculator field can be used to create a single numeric value by using 1 or more numeric fields in a mathematical expression. Value Map Field Type A value map field can be used to convert some string values to a numeric value which then can be used in business rules and action parameters Range Map Field Type A range map field can be used to convert a numerical range into a string value. Perform Action on an Entity Field A write-access user can manage Risk Exchange entity fields. Edit Field Users can edit any of the created fields. Go to Risk Exchange > Schema Editor .

Go to Risk Exchange > Business Rules . Click Create New Rule . Enter a rule name. Select the entity you want to apply the filter on. Select or enter a query in the record filter. At least one filter must be selected. Enter the folder name that you want to add it to, or you can select the existing folders. At max we can go up to 3 levels of hierarchy. Click Save . Perform an Action on Risk Exchange Business Rules You can manage all the business rules from a single place on the platform at the Business Rules page. A write-access user can mute one or multiple business rules, edit the query for business rules, or delete the business rules or test the Business Rule from this page.

Mute a Risk Exchange Business Rule Muting can be used to temporarily ignore any changes to users or hosts scores that would normally trigger the action workflow. Delete Risk Exchange Business Rules To delete a business rule, select the Trash icon on the rule and confirm the action. View Matching Records of Risk Exchange Business Rules View Matching records action can be used to view all the records that match the created business rules. Map a Risk Exchange Business Rule to an Action Users can map business rules with actions so that when a user or host matches a business rule, the configured action will be performed on the user. Go to Risk Exchange > Actions . Click Add Action Configuration . Select a Business Rule, and then a Configuration. Based on the selected configuration, a list of Actions will be populated. Select an action that you want to map to the business rule. If the action has some required parameters, you will need to fill those out as well. You can use the Source option to dynamically provide any of the fields of the matching record as the value for any action parameters. Enable Generate Alert if you would like to receive alerts in the Ticket Orchestrator module whenever an action is performed. Using this feature, users can receive alerts into your ITSM platform or receive notifications when an action is performed on users or hosts. Note that this feature requires that the Ticket Orchestrator module be enabled. Enable Require Approval if you do not want the action to be performed automatically when a record matches the business rule. If enabled, when a record matches the business rule, an action log will be added to the Action Logs page that you will have to manually approve in order to perform the action. Click Save . Actions Configured actions can be managed from Risk Exchange > Actions . Edit Actions A write-access user can update an action or the parameters of an existing action. Click the Edit icon.

Only the records updated during this period will be considered while evaluating the business rule. Checking the All Time will evaluate the records from last year. Click Fetch .

Delete Actions A write-access user can delete any of the existing configured actions. Click the Delete icon for the action you want to delete. Click Delete .

Action Logs Action logs are logs of actions performed on users or hosts. A write-access user can view and filter through action logs to view actions taken. Go to Risk Exchange > Action Logs . The logs indicate the business rule that triggered the action, and the time when this action was performed. Action Logs with status Scheduled indicate that the action is scheduled to be performed within the next few minutes or during the maintenance period if it is configured. Approve or Decline Pending Actions A write-access user can approve pending actions. Go to Risk Exchange > Action Logs .
