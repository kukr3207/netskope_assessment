  "content": "Cloud Exchange (CE) comes with four primary feature modules that can be turned on or off as needed: Log Shipper, Ticket Orchestrator, Threat Exchange, and Risk Exchange. Risk Exchange has two workflows, User Risk Exchange and Application Risk Exchange. CE is supported by Netskope, but individual plugins leverage functionality provided by 3rd-party partners. While CE comes at no cost to users, CE will only work if the attached system(s) is configured with entitlements that enable the applicable API queries and data flows. Each pluginâ€™s software and subscription requirements are defined in each respective configuration guide. This guide focuses on the complete CE platform with the four primary modules. There are three privilege levels in CE, Admin (full privileges), Write-access User (mid-range privileges) and User (limited privileges).
