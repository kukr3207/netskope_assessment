  "content": "These steps help you determine the average alerts and event generation rate for your tenant. Prerequisites A Netskope tenant with a Advanced Analytics license. A Dashboard Zip file. Download the zip file per your WebTransaction subscription state. If you have WebTransaction Subscription CE_CLS_Sizing_dashboards with WebTransaction.zip . If you do not have WebTransaction Subscription CE_CLS_Sizing_dashboards Without WebTransaction.zip . Steps In your Netskope tenant, go to Advanced Analytics and click Personal . Click Import From File , and then click Select File . Upload the zip File you downloaded earlier, and click then Upload . Wait for the upload to be completed, and then click on the imported Dashboard. Wait for the dashboard to get loaded. By default, this dashboard will provide the alerts and events counts for the last 7 days. Now do the sum of all the alerts and events, and divide it with 10080 (minutes in 7 days is 60 * 24 * 7). The output of that number will be your EPM. If your total sum is 1764000000, then your EPM will be 175000 (175k). If your EPM is less than 100k, then you should consider deploying a Medium profile of CE (8 CPU, 16 GB ram, 80 GB disk space). If your EPM is greater than 100k and less than 200k, then you should consider deploying a Large profile of CE (16 CPU, 32 GB ram, 120 GB disk space). If your EPM is greater than 200k, then you should consider deploying multiple Cloud Exchange deployments, and divide the alert events pulling so that the alerts events pulling remains below 200k EPM.",
