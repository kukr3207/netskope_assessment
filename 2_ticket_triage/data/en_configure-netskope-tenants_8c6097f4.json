Beginning with CE v5.1.0, tenants are added using the Netskope Tenant plugin. For details, go here . You need your Netskope tenant API token(s) to complete this procedure. Obtain your v1 RESTful API token by following the steps in REST API v1 Overview . CE uses v1 tokens for updating file hashes in Threat Exchange. Important A v1 token is required for adding a Netskope tenant in CE, but will not be used if an equivalent v2 endpoint is available.
