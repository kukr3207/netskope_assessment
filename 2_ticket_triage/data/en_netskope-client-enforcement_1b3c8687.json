  "content": "The Client SSO integration allows organizations to enforce steering cloud application traffic to Netskope’s cloud for very precise and granular analysis. If the Netskope Client is not present or disabled on the device, the user will be redirected from the SSO portal to the Netskope and the client installation and activation is enforced. Netskope supports and integrates with the following SSO providers: Okta: The Netskope-Okta integration allows organizations to enforce steering cloud application traffic to Netskope’s cloud for very precise and granular analysis. If the Netskope Client is not present on the device, the source IP coming to Okta is not going to be a Netskope proxy IP. The user is redirected to the Netskope page (Client checker) for Client installation and activation. OneLogin: The Netskope-OneLogin integration allows organizations to enforce steering cloud application traffic to Netskope’s cloud for very precise and granular analysis. You can configure the Netskope Client with OneLogin’s application policies. When a user accesses a SaaS app, traffic is redirected through a SAML redirection from OneLogin to the Netskope (Client checker) page. Once the Client is installed and activated, the user can access the SaaS app. SAML Proxy-based Client enforcement: In this case, Netskope acts as a SAML proxy and integrates with the SAML SPs and SAML . You can access the Enforcement page by clicking Settings > Security Cloud Platform > Netskope Client > Enforcement .",
