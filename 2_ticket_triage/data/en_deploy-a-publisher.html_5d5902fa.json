  "content": "The Netskope Private Access Publisher can be deployed on AWS, Azure, GCP, HyperV, VMWare ESXi, and any Ubuntu 22.04 based machine. The following sections provide the requirements and some recommendations, plus instructions for each of these deployments. Note A Ubuntu 22.04 minimized server image cannot be supported as it does not contain systemd-resolve , which is required when running the install script. The Publisher does not need to be deployed on the same network where the private app will be accessed, but it needs to have L3 reachability to the Private Apps. Using at least a pair of Publishers for each Private App is recommended so they can provide high-availability access. Note Netskope recommends that you replace existing Centos-based Publishers with new Publishers that are based on Ubuntu OS. All Publisher releases starting with r94 support Ubuntu OS. To deploy a new Publisher, follow the instructions in Create a New Publisher . To learn how to transition a CentOS-based Publisher to an Ubuntu-based Publisher, go to CentOS-based Publisher Support End of Life . Note A Publisher needs reachability to the official Ubuntu Mirrors during the update process. Please review and allow the appropriate destinations for a successful Publisher software update.
