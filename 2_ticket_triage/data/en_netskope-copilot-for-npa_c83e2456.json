  "content": "For many organizations, the Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) journey begins with Application Discovery in Netskope One Private Access. Typically, Application Discovery is activated by configuring broad access to private applications using IP subnets (e.g., the 10.0.0.0/8 subnet) or wildcard domains (e.g., *.corp.com). While this broad configuration effectively identifies the full range of private applications within an organization, it can also lead to operational complexity, making it difficult for administrators to manually review and refine thousands of discovered applications into more precise application segments and ZTNA policies. To address this, Private access leverages built-in AI/ML capabilities that audit existing configurations and recommend optimized application segments and ZTNA policies based on real-time usage data, making the shift from broad to precise zero trust enforcement faster and easier. Audit Use Cases NPAâ€™s AI/ML features assist administrators by automatically surfacing: Unused configurations: Identifies unused hosts, application segments, or dormant policies for administrators to assess and potentially cleanup. Obsolete or ineffective policy rules: Flags policies that are incorrectly ordered or no longer in use, helping streamline and optimize your policy set. Configuration Recommendation Use Cases Based on real-world usage patterns, Private Access provides actionable, context-aware recommendations to help organizations shift from broad access policies to precise, user-specific access. Examples include: Redefining IP subnet scopes: Suggesting narrowing broad IP ranges (e.g., from 10.0.0.0/16 to a narrower 10.0.0.0/24 subnet) for more granular control. Limiting access to specific hosts: Recommending restricting access based on host-level usage insights and analytics. Building intelligent policy rules: Proposing comprehensive policies for private applications based on specific user roles, device types, and location criteria. This reduces manual effort and enables easier adoption of least-privileged, context-driven access with precision-driven ZTNA policies. Related Article Netskope Copilot",
