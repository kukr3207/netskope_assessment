  "content": "This section describes various options to uninstall the Client from end-user devices. Client uninstallation does not automatically remove tenant certificates. For more related details, reach out to Netskope support. Uninstall Client in macOS The following options list the steps to uninstall Netskope Client in your macOS device: Option 1 Go to Applications and click the Remove Netskope Client icon. Enter your credentials to proceed with the uninstallation of the client. When uninstalling Netskope Client on devices running Big Sur (macOS 11), users are prompted to enter their credentials twice to uninstall the Network extension app proxy and to remove the Netskope client. Option 2 Create a shell script (for example, uninstall.sh ) using the following command and execute it on the user’s device to uninstall the Client. #!bin/bash /Applications/Remove\\ Netskope\\ Client.app/Contents/MacOS/Remove\\ Netskope\\ Client uninstall_me exit To uninstall using a password, use the following command: #!/bin/bash /Applications/Remove\\ Netskope\\ Client.app/Contents/MacOS/Remove\\ Netskope\\ Client uninstall_me <password in plain text> exit Add a blank space before Netskope and Client in this script. Option 3 The following section describes the instructions to uninstall Netskope Client using various MDMs. Use the jamfuninstall_v2.sh script available for download as part of JAMF scripts in the Downloads section of the Support portal. When using this script for uninstalling, enter your password as the fourth parameter in the script in the JAMF policy using the set command below: set -- 0 0 0 <yourUninstallPassword> – Auto-removal of extensions is currently supported only from release 95.1.2 onwards and not for versions prior to 95.1.2. However, when creating profiles in JAMF, selecting the Removable System Extension option under the System Extension Type option will prevent user approval requests during manual Client un-installation. This is applicable for macOS Monterey (version 12) and later. – Setting the System Extension to Removable results in the extension unloading and the Netskope client disables as a result. To ensure proper execution, you must configure your MDM to make the System Extension Removable and then run the uninstall script. – It is recommended that you create a separate configuration profile and script for the uninstallation for specific machines or users as required. Changing the existing configuration profile for the system extension will result in clients disabling and users receiving requests for manual approval. Jamf This section describes the steps to uninstall Netskope Client in macOS devices using Jamf.
