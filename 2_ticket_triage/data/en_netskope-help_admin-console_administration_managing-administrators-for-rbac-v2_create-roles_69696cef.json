  "content": "With role-based administration, you can easily add admins and assign them specific roles, with differing levels of access to the Netskope platform. Netskope recommends adding roles before adding admins because you will need to select a role for each admin that you create. When configuring roles: You must have the proper permissions to do so You can only create, edit, or delete roles with the same or less privileges Note You can only view roles for which you have higher permissions. You must have organization-wide access permissions To configure admin roles: Navigate to Settings > Administration > Roles . Click New Role . The New Role window displays. In the New Role window: Role Name : type a name for the admin role. Role Description : type a short optional description for the admin role. This description is visible in the Roles list page. Privileges tab: select the functional areas the admin can access. You must select at least one functional area.

Also, click the sub-choices within the Access Control, DLP, and Threat Protection category to provide even more granular control. Page Permissions : select pages the admin can access. Scope tab: the adminâ€™s scope specifies which areas of the platform an admin can manage. The tenant admin has scope over the entire platform.
