Operating System Cpu Utilization (Range) Battery Utilization (Range) Disk Space Memory Notes Windows and macOS 0 - 5 % Not Applicable ~100 MB for installation ~50 MB for Log and Configuration Between 100 - 150 MB Log retention space might vary depending on the level of logging. CPU utilization can vary with the traffic processing. Linux ~45 MB for installation, log and configuration storage ~0.5 % Android, iOS, and ChromeOS Not Applicable 10 - 20 % iOS and Android: ~20 MB for installation ChromeOS: ~35 MB for installation Between 4 - 12 MB for Log and configuration storage. - Log retention space might vary depending on the level of logging. Battery utilization can increase intermittently when the Client is processing traffic. It is important to note that other external factors can affect battery life of mobile devices. For example, battery drain due to poor cellular network. For mobile devices, Netskope Client uses cellular data when the device is not connected to Wifi.
