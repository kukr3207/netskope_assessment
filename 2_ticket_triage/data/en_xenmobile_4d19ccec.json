When fail open is enabled, all iOS devices will no longer steer traffic to Netskope. Fail open occurs when Netskope initiates it due to a service interruption and when an admin enables it in the Netskope UI. To enable fail open for iOS VPN: In the Netskope UI, go to Settings > Security Cloud Platform > MDM Distribution . In the Create VPN Configuration section, confirm that your iOS VPN is operational. If so, click the icon to open the Advanced Configuration dialog box. Enable the toggle and then click Save .",
